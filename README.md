Buying goverment funds with a bot

This trading bot will be hooked to a TD Ameritrade account. The project will utilize the Unofficial TD Ameritrade Python API Library. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this trade bot is to tell it what to buy, sell and also do the algorithmic trading.

## Challenge
The first challenge is to get it to buy government bonds. Government bonds are triple A rating bonds and can be brought for a short-term spam (a year or less).

They are considered to be quite safe and due to interest rates (increasing). It's a good investment to go into. It's a better investment than any savings account from any commercial bank.

This trading bot will be buying $5,000 USD government bonds. My goal is to get it to buy 5 bonds.

## What do you need?

+ A TD Ameritrade account, account number and password
+ A TD Ameritrade Developer Account
+ A consumer ID
+ A Redirect URI, also called Redirect URL
+ Python 3.7 or later

This was taken from the Unofficial TD Ameritrade Python API Library
